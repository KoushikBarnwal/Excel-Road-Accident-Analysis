# Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis

The Road Accident Analytics Dashboard! This powerful Excel-based dashboard provides in-depth analysis and visualization of road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022.

With the goal of understanding and addressing road safety requirements, this dashboard offers key performance indicators and valuable insights into road accidents. Here are some of its features:
- Total Casualties Analysis
- Casualties by Severity and Vehicle Type
- Casualties by Vehicle Type
- Monthly Trend Analysis
- Road Type Analysis
- Casualties Distribution by Road Surface
- Casualties Relation by Area/Location & Day/Night

To create this dashboard, I followed a structured approach, including data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization. By utilizing Excel's capabilities, I transformed the raw data into meaningful charts, graphs, and interactive visuals that make the information easily accessible and digestible. 
Also performed required SQL queries for more clarifications and logic behind analysis.

# Steps
- Requirement gathering from client
- Identify the Stakeholders of the Project
-  Data cleaning as per the requirement
- Data Processing by adding some customized columns in data
- Data Analysis by Pivot Tables and Excel Functions
- Data Visualization to create charts and custom sheets to show the insights
- Report/ Dashboard creation from start to end
  
# The key insights obtained from this project are truly eye-opening:
- The total number of casualties that occurred after accidents is a staggering 417,883.
- Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total. On the other hand, casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.
- In the years 2021 and 2022, the total casualties were 222,146 and 195,737, respectively. Analyzing the trends between these two years provides valuable insights for targeted interventions.
- The analysis revealed specific months with the highest and lowest casualties, enabling focused strategies for different times of the year.
- By identifying the road types and surfaces associated with the maximum casualties, authorities can prioritize safety measures and road maintenance efforts accordingly.
This Road Accident Analytics Dashboard opens the door to data-driven decision-making, enabling stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions that enhance road safety. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates alike.
